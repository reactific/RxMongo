/** RxMongo Driver
  *
  * This provides the driver for interacting with any group of Replica Sets. A given client can instantiate multiple
  * Drivers or (typically) just use a single instance. The Driver manages, through its Supervisor, a set of Connection
  * actors. A Connection here is not the same as a TCP network connection to a single MongoD or MongoS. In RxMongo, a
  * Connection is an actor that actively stays connected to a replica set, according to its configured values, even
  * through failover and failback. The user may connect in this way to as many replica sets as is needed.
  *
  * The Driver provides a very low level interface to MongoDB. It allows messages to be sent to a replica set and
  * responses returned. No higher level facilities for making interaction with the driver are provided. For that,
  * use the [[rxmongo.client.Client]] class. To send messages to a replica set, you must send requests to
  * the Connection actor returned by the connect() methods.
  *
  * Each Driver contains an Akka ActorSystem that is used to manage the concurrent non-blocking communication with
  * MongoDB. Since a Driver is a [[java.io.Closeable]], it is important to `close()` the driver when you're done with
  * it so the Akka resources are released.
  *
  * @see [[rxmongo.driver.Connection]]
  * @param cfg An optional configuration with which to configure the RxMongo driver. It defaults to the configuration
  * included with the RxMongo library as a resource (rxmongo.conf)
  * @param name An optional name for this instance of the Driver. In situations where more than one driver is
  * instantiated, this may become necessary in order to distinguish the various driver's actors by name.
