  *          belongs to a chunk owned by the shard, cleanupOrphaned continues to examine the next

  *            before returning.
  * @param writeConcern Optional. A document that expresses the write concern that the secondaryThrottle will use to
  *       wait for the secondaries when removing orphaned data. Any specified writeConcern implies
