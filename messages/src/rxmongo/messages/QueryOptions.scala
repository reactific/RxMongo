/** The Options For A Query
  *
  * @param numberToSkip The number of documents to skip. Sets the number of documents to omit - starting from the first
  * document in the resulting dataset - when returning the result of the query.
  * @param numberToReturn The number of documents to return in the first OP_REPLY batch. Limits the number of
  *    documents in the first OP_REPLY message to the query. However, the database will still
  *    establish a cursor and return the cursorID to the client if there are more results than
  *    numberToReturn. If the client driver offers ‘limit’ functionality (like the SQL LIMIT
  *    keyword), then it is up to the client driver to ensure that no more than the specified
  *    number of documents are returned to the calling application. If numberToReturn is 0, the
  *    db will use the default return size. If the number is negative, then the database will
  *    return that number and close the cursor. No further results for that query can be fetched.
  *    If numberToReturn is 1 the server will treat it as -1 (closing the cursor automatically).
  * @param tailableCursor Tailable means cursor is not closed when the last data is retrieved. Rather, the cursor
  *    marks the final object’s position. You can resume using the cursor later, from where it was
  *    located, if more data were received. Like any “latent cursor”, the cursor may become invalid
  *    at some point (CursorNotFound) – for example if the final object it references were deleted.
  * @param slaveOk Allow query of replica slave. Normally these return an error except for namespace “local”.
  * @param noCursorTimeout The server normally times out idle cursors after an inactivity period (10 minutes) to
  *     prevent excess memory use. Set this option to prevent that.
  * @param awaitData Use with TailableCursor. If we are at the end of the data, block for a while rather than
  * returning no data. After a timeout period, we do return as normal.
  * @param exhaust Stream the data down full blast in multiple “more” packages, on the assumption that the client
  * will fully read all data queried. Faster when you are pulling a lot of data and know you want to
  * pull it all down. Note : the client is not allowed to not read all the data unless it closes
  * the connection.
  * @param partial Get partial results from a mongos if some shards are down (instead of throwing an error)
