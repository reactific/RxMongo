/** Primary Application Interface To RxMongo
  *
  * Each Client instance provides a separate interface to MongoDB. It can manage connections to multiple
  * replica sets and coordinate the activity between them. Your application must instantiate an Client in order
  * to use RxMongo as all other objects provided by RxMongo are accessed through this one. You may instantiate multiple
  * Client instances, but each will maintain its own set of connections and view of the databases. This may be
  * useful in testing but is unlikely to be useful in an application unless you wish to keep replica set traffic
  * separate.
  *
  * The Client is a wrapper around the [[rxmongo.driver.Driver]] object that allow you to avoid the low level
  * interface of the Driver. Instead of dealing directly with connections to a MongoDB server, you deal with
  * abstractions like [[rxmongo.client.Database]], [[rxmongo.client.Collection]], [[Query]] and
  * [[rxmongo.client.Cursor]].
